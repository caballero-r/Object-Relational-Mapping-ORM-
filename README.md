## Description
This project was created using a starter code provided by the University of Toronto, Continuing Studies, Full Stack Developer BootCamp. 
In this project we are connecting to our database and seeding the test information provided. The user will then be able to use their own database management system to create, read, update, and delete information from the database once they have initiated the application and connected to the server.
